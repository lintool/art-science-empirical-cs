# Assignment: Debates

**The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science (Fall 2022)**

Throughout the semester we'll be engaging in a number of structured discussions (i.e., "debates") focused on specific topics, illustrated with two contrary positions.
These are designed to introduce you to different "styles" of research and how you might allocate effort across different research activities.
Time is zero sum, and there are opportunity costs to everything.
There are no right answers, and there are many different ways to succeed.
The goal of these exercises is to help you think about what type of researcher you want to become.

Here are the debate topics:

+ Topic 1: quality _only_ or quality _and_ quantity?
  + Position A: Researchers should be evaluated _solely_ on the quality of their publications. Quantity is irrelevant and we shouldn't even bother counting.
  + Position B: Researchers should be evaluated on _both_ the quality _and_ quantity of their publications. High-quality publications are of course important, but quantity is also an important component of productivity.
+ Topic 2: collaborate or not?
  + Position A: Early-stage researchers should actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Participation in multiple research projects across many different groups builds breadth.
  + Position B: Early-stage researchers should _not_ actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Focusing on depth is more important than breadth.
+ Topic 3: code dump or more?
  + Position A: Early-stage researchers should do the minimal in open-sourcing computational artifacts that arise from their work. Doing anything more than the community norm is a waste of time and effort that could be better spent writing more papers.
  + Position B: Early-stage researchers should actively promote the adoption of computational artifacts that arise from their work, for example, contributing to popular open-source libraries. Even if this requires a lot of time (e.g., refactoring code into a production-ready state), such efforts are worthwhile.

So as to ensure that all students enrolled have a chance to participate, I'll add more debate topics later in the semester.
