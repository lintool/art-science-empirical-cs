## Course Description

Graduate students in computer science aspire to "do computer science" (research), but what exactly does that mean?
It involves, among a multitude of activities, reading papers, learning the latest techniques and models, advancing knowledge, writing papers, and (hopefully) getting them published.
Graduate students learn how to do these things under tutelage of professors, but rarely is there explicit or deliberate instruction on these myriad activities.
With a focus on _empirical_ computer science, this course covers elements that comprise the research enterprise, synthesizing both "art" &mdash; personal experiences I have accumulated over the years &mdash; as well as "science" &mdash; insights derived from quantitative analyses.
The hope is that knowledge and actionable advice from this course will help graduate students better understand research, hopefully leading to more productive and fulfilling careers.
