# The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science

## Logistics

+ **Semester**: Fall 2022
+ **Instructor**: [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/)
+ **Time & Location**: Mondays 12:30-02:50, DC 2568

## Course Description

Graduate students in computer science aspire to "do computer science" (research), but what exactly does that mean?
It involves, among a multitude of activities, reading papers, learning the "state of the art", advancing knowledge, writing papers, and (hopefully) getting them published.
Graduate students learn how to do these things under tutelage of professors, but rarely is there explicit or deliberate instruction on these myriad activities.
With a focus on _empirical_ computer science, this course covers elements that comprise the research enterprise, synthesizing both "art" &mdash; personal experiences I have accumulated over the years &mdash; as well as "science" &mdash; insights derived from quantitative analyses.
The hope is that knowledge and actionable advice from this course will help graduate students better understand research, hopefully leading to more productive and fulfilling careers.

Material for this course will draw from ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barab√°si, academic papers, as well as other sources on the web.

## Assignments

In addition to weekly preparation (readings and other material), the course will have the following assignments:

+ Preparation and participation in a debate. These debates will be scattered throughout the semester, where the debate topics will be complementary to the topic of that week.
+ Literature review and presentation of a technological solution to a challenge related to the topics covered in this course (Weeks 11 and 12).
+ Visualization project due in mid-October.
+ Final project due at the end of the semester.
