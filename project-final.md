# Assignment: Final Project

**The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science (Fall 2022)**

The final project is due Tuesday, December 20, 2022 at noon, by email.
The deliverable is a research paper on a topic related to any of the topics covered in this course.
Please send me a PDF.
You can choose to work alone or in a group with up to three members.

For the final project, target the substance and quality of your work to a level that can be submitted to an academic workshop.
For example, here are some upcoming workshops:

+ [Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval](https://sites.google.com/view/bir-ws/home): longstanding workshop series, deadline for 2023 edition is Jan 2023.
+ [3rd Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing](https://sdproc.org/2022/) @ COLING 2022 (will be a 4th edition some time in 2023)

Here are some workshops in the recent past:

+ [Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/WIESP/) @ AACL-IJCNLP 2022
+ [2nd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment](https://sci-k.github.io/2022/) @ The Web Conf 2022
+ [Understanding LIterature references in academic full TExt](https://exciteproject.github.io/ULITE-ws/) @ JCDL 2022
+ [Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications Series](https://wosp.core.ac.uk/)

Most of these workshops exist as part of a long-running series: Browse old proceedings to find inspiration!
Of course, you should not be limited by these workshops, as there are plenty of topics covered in the course that are not represented in these workshops.
